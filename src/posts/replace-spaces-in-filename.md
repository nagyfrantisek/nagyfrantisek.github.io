As Linux users, we frequently encounter issues when file commands or applications stop working because of a space in a filename. This can often be caused by file operations or habits like saving files with spaces in their names. In this article, weâ€™ll explore several methods for renaming such files by removing or replacing the spaces in the filename.

## Bash script:

```
#!/bin/bash

ls | while read -r FILE
do
    mv -v "$FILE" `echo $FILE | tr ' ' '_' `
done   

```
